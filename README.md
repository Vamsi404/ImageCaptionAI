# ImageCaptionAI
This repository contains a deep learning-based model for generating captions for images using a combination of computer vision (ResNet50) and natural language processing (LSTM). The model is trained on the Flickr8k dataset, with GloVe embeddings for word representations. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and inference scripts.
